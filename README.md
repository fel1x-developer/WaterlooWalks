# WATIsGrass

A helpful guide to navigate UW's bridges and tunnels! Just enter a start and end location and it will calculate the shortest possible indoor route for you.

The original code was created by [rickyqin005](https://github.com/rickyqin005/WATIsGrass) targeted for web and Android. As the mobile app doesn't support iOS yet, I modified the code to support iOS as well. The core logic remains the same whereas the UI is built from scratch.

Since the original code is licensed under the GPL v3, I had to modify the code to comply with the license. The modified code is licensed under the GPL v3 as well.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   bun expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
